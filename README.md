Hello and welcome to my profile. I'm @pyro1136. 

I am an educator who works with adults looking to improve their skills. My current projects are mostly working on online educational aids for students to use. 

You can check the ongoing project here:- https://slotheducation.com/

I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python and pretty much everything all of the time.
